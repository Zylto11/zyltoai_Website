# React App

This is a React application that you can run locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: You can download and install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Comes installed with Node.js.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already cloned the repository, open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Folder

Change the directory to your project folder:

```bash
cd your-repository-name
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies for the app using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file.

### 4. Run the React App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app on a local server. By default, the app will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Open this URL in your browser to view the app.

### 5. Build for Production

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` folder with the optimized production build of your app.

### 6. Additional Scripts

If you want to use other npm scripts, they can be found in the `package.json` under the `scripts` section.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with missing packages, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, and then run `npm install` again.
- If the app doesn't load in the browser, ensure that your `localhost` port is not being used by another application.
